# AW9523 is a 16 I/O Port-Expander
#### What is it?
AW9523 is a 16 I/O Port-Expander. Very cheap and easy to use with Arduino.

Arduino Library: [Github](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_AW9523)


#### Why did you make it?
I looked for a cheap and small port Expander and found that part on LCSC, so I created this PCB.

#### What makes it special?
AW9523 Features:

- 16 multi-function I/O, each for LED drive (current-source dimming) or GPIO mode
- 256 steps linear dimming in LED drive mode
- Any GPIO can be configured as an input or an output independently
- Support interrupt, 8us deglitch, low-level active
- Standard I2C interface, A1/A0 select I2C device address
- SDA, SCL, SHDN, and all GPIO can accept in 1.8V logic input
- ESD protection: ±4000V HBM (MIL-STD-883H Method 3015.8 standard）
- Latch-up ：±450mA（ JEDEC STANDARD NO.78C SEPTEMBER 2010 standard）
- Supply shutdown function, low-level active
- 2.5V~5.5V power supply
- I2C address default 0x58 (can be 0x59, 0x5A or 0x5B)
